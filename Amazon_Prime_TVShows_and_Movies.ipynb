        "The dataset consists of two main tables: one with **9,871** entries detailing movies and TV shows, and another with **124,235** records mapping cast members to these titles. The first dataset includes metadata such as title, genre, IMDb and TMDb scores, runtime, and production country, while the second dataset provides actor names, roles, and character information. A significant issue in the data is missing values, particularly in `age_certification` (66% missing), `seasons` (mostly for movies), and `imdb_score` and `tmdb_score` (missing for around 1,000 and 2,000 titles, respectively). Additionally, the `character` column in the cast dataset is incomplete for over **16,000** entries, likely representing crew members rather than actors. There are also duplicate records (**3 in the movie dataset and 56 in the cast dataset**) that need to be addressed. These inconsistencies may impact analysis, especially for rating-based insights and recommendation models. Cleaning steps should include imputing missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency. Visualizations, such as heatmaps and histograms, could help identify patterns in missing data and rating distributions."
