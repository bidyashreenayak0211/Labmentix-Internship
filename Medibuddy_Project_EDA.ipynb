        "The dataset comprises **1,338 rows and 8 columns**, representing insurance-related information for a group of individuals. Each row corresponds to a unique policyholder, as indicated by the non-null **Policy no.**, and there are no duplicate or missing entries, ensuring the dataset is complete and clean. The columns include demographic details such as **age**, **sex**, **number of children**, **smoking status**, and **region**. Additionally, it provides health-related data like **BMI (Body Mass Index)** and financial data like **insurance charges (in INR)**. The absence of missing values and duplicates makes this dataset reliable for analysis. The mix of categorical (e.g., sex, smoker, region) and numerical variables (e.g., age, bmi, charges) suggests it's well-suited for exploring patterns in healthcare costs, performing statistical analysis, or building predictive models related to insurance pricing."

Smokers and individuals classified as obese consistently exhibit higher claim amounts, underscoring the direct relationship between unhealthy lifestyle choices and increased healthcare costs.\n",

        "Geographical location also proves to be a crucial variable, with the southeast region recording the highest average claims. This could be attributed to regional disparities in healthcare access, lifestyle patterns, or local health risks. Furthermore, age and family size (number of dependents) have a clear positive correlation with claim amounts—older policyholders and those with more dependents tend to submit higher claims, likely due to more frequent or complex medical needs.\n",

        "To capitalize on these insights and enhance business performance, the company should consider adopting a risk-adjusted pricing strategy. By charging higher premiums to higher-risk groups (such as smokers and individuals with high BMI), while offering incentives or discounts to healthier individuals, the insurer can encourage positive behavior change and reduce the overall claims burden.\n",

Customized insurance plans based on age brackets and family composition can further increase customer satisfaction and retention by offering more relevant and affordable options.\n",
